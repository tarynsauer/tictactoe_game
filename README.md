# Tic-tac-toe game with AI option

This JavaScript tic-tac-toe game allows for comptuer vs. computer, human vs. computer, and human vs. human matchups. The computer is unbeatable, and all computer vs. computer matchups result in a tie. You can play the game in a web browser.

## Getting started

To get this program, clone the repository to your local machine, then open the ```index.html``` file in a web browser.

## Playing the game

Once you've opened this file in the browser, follow these steps to begin playing the game:

1. For each player, select a marker and player type. Players must have different markers, or else an error appears.
2. Click **Start game!** button to begin playing.
3. The program randomly selects which player goes first. This selection appears in the message header.
4. Players alternate clicking on the board to add their respective marker.
5. Once one player wins or the board contains nine markers (a tie), gameplay stops and the game outcome appears in the message header.
6. Click the **New Game** button to play again.

You can click the **New Game** button at any time to restart the program.

## AI algorithm

To always be "unbeatable", computer players use the following procedure to select moves:

1. If selected to go first, place marker in a randomly chosen square.
2. On all subsequent moves, the computer calculates a total score for each possible move (i.e., for all open squares). The total score is a sum of the scores for all "win lines" (three rows, three columns, two diagonals) on the board, given that particular move. Based on the squares in the line, each "win line" score is assigned one of the following values:
  * +100 for [marker, marker, marker]
  * +10 for [marker, marker, open]
  * + 1 for [marker, open, open]
  * -1 for [opponentMarker, open, open]
  * -10 for [opponentMarker, opponentMarker, open]
  * 0 for all other combinations

3. The computer finds the square with the highest total score, and it moves its marker to that square.

This process uses a [Minimax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax) search algorithm.

## Technology

This web application uses following tools and technologies:

* [HTML5 Bloilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/)
* [JQuery](http://jquery.com/)

## Structure

The application source file ```/src/tictactoe.js``` contains the following classes:

* **Player** - defines the player object, which has a marker string, turn vlaue, and player type ('computer' or 'human').
* **Line** - defines a winning line, which includes three cell string identifiers. There are eight possible winning lines in tic-tac-toe.
* **Board** - sets the board variables for a given game, including lines and players. This class defines the AI logic, player move actions, and monitors the status of the game (win or tie).
* **Game** - sets up new games. This class starts new games, determines which player goes first, and resets the game settings panel.
